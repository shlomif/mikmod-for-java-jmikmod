[MikMod for Java](http://jmikmod.shlomifish.org/) is a port of
[MikMod](http://mikmod.sourceforge.net/), a player of
[module files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_file),
to Java / JVM . It was largely superseded by
[the JavaScript/WebAudio version of libxmp](https://github.com/wothke/libxmp-4.3.0), and is now of little interest.
